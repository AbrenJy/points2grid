PREREQUISITES
-------------
Points2Grid depends on some external libraries to get the job done -

either 

1) PDAL: Please install PDAL from https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL. Points2Grid has
   been tested to work with version 0.1.0 of PDAL.
   
   PDAL is required for certain advanced features of points2grid to work.
   
or

2) liblas: Please install liblas from http://liblas.org. Points2Grid has
   been tested to work with version 1.2.1 of liblas, and possibly some later ones too.
   
   liblas is being superseded by PDAL.  later versions of points2grid will drop support
   for liblas, and you will need to upgrade your system.

If you'd like to be able to retrieve files from remote URLS, you'll also need: 

3) curl: Please install libcurl from http://curl.haxx.se/. Points2Grid has
been tested to work with version 7.20.0 of libcurl.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Please adjust the MEM_LIMIT variable in the Interpolation.h file to reflect
the memory limitations of your system. As a rule of thumb, set the
MEM_LIMIT to be (available memory in bytes)/55. For jobs that generate
grids cells greater than the MEM_LIMIT, points2grid goes "out-of-core",
resulting in significantly worse performance.

COMPILATION
-----------

If you have installed curl and liblas at non-standard locations, please set
your CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH to respectively point to the
locations of the include files and libraries of the installed software
pre-requisites.

To compile points2grid, simply use the standard cmake procedures:

mkdir build # make a build folder
cd build
cmake ..
make

The software has been confirmed to work with gcc3 and gcc4 on Linux, Solaris
and OSX.
