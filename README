Points2Grid
------------

Points2Grid generates Digital Elevation Models (DEM) using a local gridding
method. The local gridding algorithm computes grid cell elevation using a
circular neighbourhood defined around each grid cell based on a radius
provided by the user. This neighbourhood is referred to as a bin, while the
grid cell is referred to as a DEM node. Up to four values — minimum,
maximum, mean, or inverse distance weighted (IDW) mean — are computed for
points that fall within the bin. These values are then assigned to the
corresponding DEM node and used to represent the elevation variation over
the neighbourhood represented by the bin. If no points are found within a
given bin, the DEM node receives a value of null. The Points2Grid service
also provides a null filing option, which applies an inverse distance
weighted focal mean via a square moving window of 3, 5, or 7 pixels to fill
cells in the DEM that have null values.
